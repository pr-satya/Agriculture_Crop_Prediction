# Agriculture_Crop_Prediction
I have utilized the Random Forest Regression machine learning algorithm for modeling, and it yielded an impressive accuracy of 83.24%. This accuracy outperforms other algorithms, including Decision tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Additionally, I employed a new dataset to predict crop yields using the trained Random Forest algorithm, and the yield predictions on this new dataset were also found to be accurate and reliable.
